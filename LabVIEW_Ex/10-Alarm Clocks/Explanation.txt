   
   Order of Running VIs:


   1)"Write Alarm Clocks.vi" creates a CSV file called "Alarms" on the user desktop with number of alarm 
     clocks those user set in the VI.

   2)"Read CSV File and Select Clockc.vi" reads the CSV file and selects of one of the alarm clock's 
     that user wish to use."Selected Clock(Global Variable).vi" transfers the data of alarm  
     clock to "Alarm clock.vi". So, run "Read CSV File and Select Clockc.vi" with the "Selected Clock
     (Global Variable).vi" loaded in the memory (concurrently), select the clock number and stop the 
    "Read CSV File and Select Clockc.vi", then you can close both.

   3)"Alarm clock.vi" is the simulation of alarm clock that user selected previously.
